## Joseph Spraggon

I’m a guy in my mid-twenties who's looking & ready to switch lanes and forge a new career path for myself. I'm looking to find meaningful work that will stimulate & excite me, somewhere that I can tackle different & diverse challenges, somewhere that will keep me learning about & close to, the cutting edge of software development.

I've recently left my last role as manager of Tracks Bar in Forest gate, East London. An independent bar, restaurant & record store that I helped to build from the ground up. I’m incredibly proud of what we, as a small team, have built over the last two years & just how far we’ve come. However I took the difficult decision to leave a role, & people, I truly loved to focus on my new found passion for software, not only for myself but for my young family.

I'm new to the world tech, having done about a months worth of self-teaching & now being enrolled with Makers Academy in London, but I've discovered a real drive, passion and desire to learn more & more about coding, programming and software. I've loved being challenged in new ways and using exploration & creative thinking to overcome problems & tasks. I'm excited to see where this new chapter of my life will take me, it seems in the software world, the possibilities are endless.

## Skills

#### Self Sufficient

In my last role as a manager of Tracks bar & Ransom Note Records I had to be sure that my time was used efficiently & effectively. Before the working week could begin I would have a litany of tasks to be completed, from placing orders on stock, to being sure parameters of our licence as well as fire, health & safety & CCTV measures were being upheld. I enjoy holding a lot of responsibility & know the importance of being organised, being able to prioritise and I’m able to get the workload done quickly & productively.


#### Communication

I am also good with people and have excellent communication and networking skills. I have experience setting up strong, professional relationships with suppliers, collaborators & clients alike. I’ve handled many queries & issues over the phone, via email or in person and handle all requests & concerns with an approachable attitude & can-do demeanour.
